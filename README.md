#  Film Finder Project - Codecademy

## Overview


The Film Finder Project is a web application developed during my Codecademy course, simply to use the knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file responsible for handling user interactions and making API requests.
- `helpers.js`: JavaScript file containing all helper functions.

## Project Features

This web app should allow users to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

    On the Settings page, navigate to the API section and click on the link to Request an API Key to register as a Developer.

    You’ll be asked to enter some personal information like your address and phone number. This is pretty common. Many APIs use this information to keep track of how their data is being used. As a part of your registration, you will also be asked to provide a URL for the site where you will be using this API. Here, you can list "https://codecademy.com". Check out these [instructions](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) if you need further assistance with registering for an API key.

+ After obtaining the API key, set it to the variable `tmdbKey` in the `script.js` file.

- To view the webpage locally, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
